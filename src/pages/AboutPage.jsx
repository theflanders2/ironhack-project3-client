      <p>
        Gameodex is a site where you can create a personal index of Playstation
        console games you have played, are currently playing or would like to
        play. Along with keeping track of games, you can add games to the
        database, as well as leave comments on games that other members of the
        site can also see.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site was developed as a part of the 24-week Ironhack Full-stack Web Development course using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) and is equipped with full CRUD capabilities and JWT for authentication.
